<p> Reminder: You have an endowment of ${{player.endow}} to begin with. <br> <br>

    Participant A had two compensation methods to choose to reward you for your participation for this round and they chose the following for you: <br>
    {{if group.option == 0}}
    <p>
        
        <b>Constant wage:</b><br> You will be compensated regardless of whether Participant A receive the additional reward and regardless of how many successful tasks you accomplish.
        <br> <br>
        The <b>other compensation method </b> Participant A could have selected was <b>contingent compensation form</b>: <br>
        You will only be rewarded if you reach a minimum target of tasks successfully accomplished. 
    </p>

    {{else}}
    <p>
        <b>Contingent compensation form:</b> You will only be rewarded if you reach a minimum target of tasks successfully accomplished. Your employer has set a minimum target of {{group.option}}.
        <br> <br>
        The <b>other compensation method</b> Participant A could have selected was <b>Constant wage</b>:
        <br> You will be compensated regardless of whether Participant A receive the additional reward and regardless of how many successful tasks you accomplish.
        <br> <br>
    </p>

    *Participant A will not be informed of how many times you accomplish the task, but only if they are successful in receiving the additional reward
