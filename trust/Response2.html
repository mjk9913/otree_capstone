<p> You are: Participant B. </p>

<p> You have an endowment of ${{player.endow}} to begin with. <br> <br>
    You are able to gain an additional $5, if Participant A is able to successfully gain an additional reward. <br>
    Participant A's probability of receiving the additional reward increases proportionally to the number of times you successfully accomplishes the task. <br> <br>
 
    Participant A had two compensation methods to choose to reward you for your participation and they chose the following for you: <br>
    
    {{if group.option == 0}}
    <p>
        <b> 
        <br> <br>
        Constant wage:<br> You will be compensated regardless of whether Participant A receive the additional reward and regardless of how many successful tasks you accomplish.
        <br> <br>
        The <b>other compensation method </b> Participant A could have selected was: <br>
        Contingent compensation form: You will only be rewarded if you reach a minimum target of tasks successfully accomplished. 
    </p>

    {{else}}
    <p>
        <b>Contingent compensation form:</b> You will only be rewarded if you reach a minimum target of tasks successfully accomplished. Your employer has set a minimum target of {{group.option}}.
        <br> <br>
        The <b>other compensation method</b> Participant A could have selected was <br>
        Constant wage:<br> You will be compensated regardless of whether Participant A receive the additional reward and regardless of how many successful tasks you accomplish.
        <br> <br>
    </p>

    {{endif}}
    <br><br>
    *Participant A will not be informed of how many times you accomplish the task, but only if they are successful in receiving the additional reward
